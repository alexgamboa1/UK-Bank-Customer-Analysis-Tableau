Analyze a UK Bank customer demographic across geographical locations between nation states using Tableau.

In this analysis my duties as a Data Analyst for a UK Bank was to create a dashboard that analyzes customer segmentation based on region.

**Make sure to browse over the Dashboard and view the Customer Storyline to go over each region analysis.** 


### UK Customer Map
UK customer map was created by restructuring the data to show the regions on the exact location on the global map. I then added a color scale to differentiate each region by color and added a legend for reference. I also added the amount of total customers each region has. Created filters to help specify each region in the next couple of worksheets. This map is key in the dashboard as it becomes very interactive to click on each region on the map to get customer segmentation analytics. 

### Gender Chart
This chart shows the gender in a pie chart to analyze the different demographic in each region. Filters were added to make the pie chart change based off region once this worksheet is added to the dashboard. 

## Distribution by Age 
I created a chart that illustrates the percetange of customers distributed across different age groups. I added filters to create an interactive dashboard. I also grouped together the age groups by exact age, grouping by every 5 years, and every 10 years.
